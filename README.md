# Python-Numpy TASKS

NumPy is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make
working with 'relational' or 'labeled' data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level
building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python.
The best way we learn anything is by practice and exercise questions. Here you have the opportunity to
practice the NumPy concepts by solving the exercises starting from basic to more complex exercises.
Here are a few questions youâ€™re supposed to answer after exploring NumPy on the Internet.

#TASKS 
Write a NumPy program to create an array of all even integers from 30 to 70.
Write a NumPy program to generate an array of 15 random numbers from a standard normal
distribution.
How to compute the cross-product of two matrices in NumPy?
How to compute the determinant of an array using NumPy?
How to create a 3x3x3 array with random values using NumPy?
How to create a 5x5 array with random values and find the minimum and maximum values using
NumPy?
How to compute the mean, standard deviation, and variance of a given array along the second axis in
NumPy?
